# Sign-up Form

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Daniel

This is my submission for The Odin Project's **Sign-up Form** project.

## Overview

This project is a **sign-up form** created as part of The Odin Project's **Intermediate HTML and CSS** course. The goal was to replicate a design provided by the course, with a focus on layout structure, form styling, and user interface elements. The form includes fields for name, email, password, and confirm password.

## ðŸ›  What I Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content and form elements.
- **CSS**: For styling the form and layout.
  - **CSS Pseudo-classes**: For styling input fields when focused or invalid.
  - **Colors and Shadows**: Used for input borders and button styling.
- **JavaScript** (for future validation improvement): Used to validate each input field separately.

## ðŸ¦„ Tools & Technologies

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3 (Vanilla CSS)**
- **JavaScript** (for password validation, will be implemented in the future)

## Features

- **Sign-up form** layout with fields for user details:
  - Full Name
  - Email Address
  - Password
  - Confirm Password
- **Input field validation**:
  - Invalid password field shows a red border.
  - Focused input field shows a blue border and subtle box-shadow.
- A **Create Account** button styled to match the overall design.
- **Background image** used for aesthetics.

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned

- Improved my HTML and CSS skills by creating a structured form.
- Learned to apply **CSS pseudo-classes** like `:focus` and `:invalid` for styling input fields.
- Gained experience with **background images**, **color schemes**, and **box shadows** for aesthetic form styling.
