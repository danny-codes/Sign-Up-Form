# Sign-up Form

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Daniel

This is my submission for The Odin Project's **Sign-up Form** project.

<a href='https://danny-codes.github.io/Sign-Up-Form/'>Live Version</a>

## Overview

This project is a **sign-up form** created as part of The Odin Project's **Intermediate HTML and CSS** course. The goal was to replicate a design provided by the course, with a focus on layout structure, form styling, and user interface elements. The form includes fields for name, email, password, and confirm password.

## ðŸ›  What I Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content and form elements.
- **CSS**: For styling the form and layout.
  - **CSS Pseudo-classes**: For styling input fields when focused or invalid.
  - **Colors and Shadows**: Used for input borders and button styling.
- **JavaScript** (for future validation improvement): Used to validate each input field separately.

- ## ðŸ¦„ Tools & Technologies
- **HTML5** <br> <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/html5/html5-original-wordmark.svg" alt="html5" width="40" height="40"/> </a>
